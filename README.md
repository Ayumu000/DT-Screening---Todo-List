# DT-Screening---Todo-List
I created a simple task manager where users can add tasks via a form. Each task is added to the DOM with a "Delete" button and a click-to-toggle checkmark feature. Event listeners are attached to handle marking tasks as complete and removing them. Tasks are dynamically added using innerHTML, and each new task is handled through query selection and iteration.
